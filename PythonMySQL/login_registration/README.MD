  This is my template folder to start off a modularized project/assignment in Python+Flask+MySQL.
It operates using a basic MySQL database schema called 'RENAME_SCHEMA'. This is notable because all generic identifiers used throughout this template
are prefaced with 'RENAME_' and suffixed with their appropriate identifier. It took me several hours over the course of Sat, July 16, to get it all 
filed down and in good working order, which may seem like a lot of time to put into such an endeavor.
  However, I feel as though I've learned quite a bit over this time spent; I've come to better understand how sql queries work,
how our cofiguration file acts as a wrapper to make dealing with PyMySQL much simpler, and how the flow of data works between our M, V, and C.
  Finally, this is a solid foundation upon which to build out the remaining assignments, Belt exam, and final project for this stack. I know it's a simple thing to have finished,
but I like it, and it's mine.
